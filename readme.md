# Snake Game

this snake game has been created as a requirement for a semester project at the university of Kiel.
the game is very similar to the original, old-mobilephone versions of the snake game and consists of 8 levels.


## Rules of the Game

move the snake `up, down, left, right` using the `Arrow-Up, Arrow-Down, Arrow-Left, Arrow-Right` buttons respectively. 

if you run throw the grid borders or the obstacles (`brown rectangles`), the game is over.
collect food (`yellow rectangles`) to increase you score and reach higher levels.

each game level has a `maximum Score`. if you collect enough food, the next level is unlocked!

the high level concept is made in a way that the browser only saves high score in a specific round.
once you play again and pass level 1, the storage high score will start counting again from Level 2 and so on.

if you reach level 8 and reach the maximum Score, the game will start from the beginning.

## Controls

the game was supposed to be made compatible to play only on desktop devices. the further mobile devices compatibility was not implemented due to time reasons.
